# Video-Game-Character-Optimizer

To run project run the command 'ruby weapon_analyzer.rb'


Goals for this project

To iterate through a list of ***melee only weapons*** and output an object showing the best characteristics and the name of the weapon.

Early in this project, this is for melee weapons that have not been upgraded/modified at any blacksmith.  They are completely stock.

As this project goes on, I can put modified weapons in the raw data. (e.g  Dagger +10, Fire Longsword +10)


This means that it does not include
1. Catalysts
2. Bows/Crossbows
