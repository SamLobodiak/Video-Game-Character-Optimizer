# Video-Game-Character-Optimizer

Goals for this project
1.  Currently, I plan to play with weapon data to analyze various weapon strengths. (e.g. What is the most physically damaging single hit weapon? What is the highest damage per second weapon?  What is the most damaging weapon of combined physical and elemental damage?)
2.  In the future, I want to find what is the most damaging, per weight, per stat requirement weapon that I can use. (Find most balanced character build)

***Dark Souls information***
This project will be based on a player with an equipment load max of 100.
This is about a level 70 characer, a roughly avergage end game player level.

The sum of all equipment weight worn makes a player have the mobility of either fast, mid, or slow.
Fast mobility (fast rolling, backstepping, and running) = <25% equipment load max
Mid mobility (mid speed rolling, backstepping, and running) = >=25% to <50% equipment load max
Slow mobility (slow "fat" speed rolling, backstepping, and running) = >=50% to <75%



The resources used to equip a weapon are 2 things.
  1. Minimum stat requirements (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Faith)
    a.  1 character level gained can be used to get 1 of the stats above.
  2. Weight units
    a.  Weight units bring the character closer to their moblity breakpoints of fast, mid, and slow. (e.g . The bigger the weapon the more weight units added onto your equipment load.  This leads to the player not wearing as much armor which makes them have lower defence.  I hope to optimize this and create a character that has both good attack and good defense.)


After a weapon is chosen, I then plan to optimize armor with the unused weight space in concordance to the mobility breakpoints.
