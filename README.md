# Video-Game-Character-Optimizer

******SECTION 1*******

The goal of this project is to see which weapons are optimal to use in Dark Souls for a player with an equipment load max of 100.
This is about average for end game players.

'optimal' means what is the most damaging, per weight, per stat requirement weapon that I can use.

The resources used to equip a weapon are 2 things.
  1. Minimum stat requirements (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Faith)
    a.  Each time the player levels up, they may choose to put 1 stat point into any of the stats above.
  2. Weight units
    a.  The bigger the weapon the more weight units added onto your equipment load.
        This leads to the player not wearing as much armor which makes them have lower defence

*****SECTION 2*****
After a weapon is chosen, I then plan to optimize armor with the leftover weight space we can use for armour.
